Install:

## Installation

- Put the `instagram.php` file in your `site/plugins` folder. If this folder doesn't exist yet, create it.
- In order to interact with the Instagram API, you need to obtain an access token for yourself.
- Visit <http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/> and register an application.
- Set the OAuth redirect_uri to the main URL (i.e. http://yourdomain.com) of your website.
- Copy the Client-ID of the newly created app.
- Visit:

```
https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=http://yourdomain.com&response_type=token
```

â€¦in your browser, but replace CLIENT-ID with your client-id and YOURDOMAIN.COM with the OAuth redirect_uri you've entered while registering your app.

- The browser will redirect you to your own website and in the address bar you will find your access token like this:

```
http://yourdomain.com/#access_token=xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxx
```

- Copy the access token (everything after =) and save it somewhere.
- Implement the plugin into your template.
