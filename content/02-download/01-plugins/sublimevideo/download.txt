## Installation

1. Copy the `sublimevideo.php` file into your `site/plugins` folder. If the plugins folder doesn't exist yet, please create it. As a plugin, the file will be automatically loaded by Kirby.

2. Put your SublimeVideo embed code inside the `<head>` tag of your site. It should look like this :

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.sublimevideo.net/js/YOUR_TOKEN.js"></script>
```

Please note that you need to have a [SublimeVideo account](http://sublimevideo.net/plans) (free). This service is very easy to use but if you need help, please refer to [their documentation](http://docs.sublimevideo.net/quickstart-guide). I am also not going to discuss [video encoding](http://docs.sublimevideo.net/encode-videos-for-the-web) here.
