Install:

## Installation

- Copy the auth folder to your site/plugins folder.
- Copy auth/snippets/login.php to your snippets folder and optionally customize it
- Create an invisible content/login folder with a login.txt
- Create a login.php template in site/templates and include the login form snippet. I.e.:


```php

<!-- site/templates/login.php -->
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('login') ?>
<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

- Create an invisible content/logout folder with a logout.txt
- Crate a logout.php template in site/templates:

```php
    <?php Auth::logout() ?>
```

- Create an site/accounts folder and add your first user account. Use the username as filename (ie. yourusername.php)

```php

<?php if(!defined('KIRBY')) exit ?>

<!-- setup your account credentials here -->

```

It's highly recommended to use md5 or sha1 encryption for your passwords. read more about encryption in the (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/accounts text: docs:)

username: yourusername
password: yourpassword
group:    optional-group-name

Now you have a fully functional login/logout system.
