Install:

## Installation

Put the `readlater.php` file in your `site/plugins` folder.

## How to use it

Simple! Put `<?php echo readlater($page->title(),'instapaper') ?>` in your template and it will echo the a link that let´s you save the page to Instapaper. Do you want to use Pocket? Then you use `<?php echo readlater($page->title(),'pocket') ?>` in your template.

You can pass any other page variable to use for the title. I asume that you use `$page->title()` for the title but you are free to change it.
