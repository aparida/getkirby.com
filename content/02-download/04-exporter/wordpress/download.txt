## Installation

Download `wordpress.php` and put it in the main directory of your Kirby site. Open `wordpress.php` in your favorite editor and setup the url to your blog and your wordpress username and password. You should also make sure that `$root` is setup to the folder where all the exported articles should be stored and that this folder is writable. (change permissions to 0755)

MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR CONTENT FOLDER TO BE SURE TO NOT LOSE ANY DATA.

Open <http://yourkirbydomain.com/wordpress.php> in your browser to start the exporter.
