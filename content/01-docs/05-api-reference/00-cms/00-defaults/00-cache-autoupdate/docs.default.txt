Title: cache.autoupdate
----
Value: <pre>true</pre>
----
Description: When autoupdate is set to true, Kirby will check
all subfolders of your content folder for changes
and use modifications to auto-flush the cache.
To get better performance in some cases, you might
want to switch this off. But you must flush the cache
manually in this case or rely on the Panel.
