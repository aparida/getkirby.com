Description: The content object is an extended File
object which is used for all content text files.

Content objects are used for the main content, site info and
meta information for other files.

Page objects access their main content object
to return custom field data.

i.e. $page->title() is the same as $page->content()->title()

Content objects have many child Variable objects
for each parsed field in the text file.
So all custom field contents are Variable objects.
