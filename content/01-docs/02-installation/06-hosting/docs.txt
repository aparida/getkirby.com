## Requirements

Kirby runs best on Linux, Apache and PHP 5.3+
Pretty much any modern hosting provider should have a plan,
which matches those requirements.

Kirby has also been successfully installed on LightHTTPD and Nginx. Please send me an email if you got a working version of Kirby running on any other server architecture: <bastian@getkirby.com>

### URL rewriting

I recommend having `mod_rewrite` or a comparable URL rewriting module enabled, as it will help Kirby to build awesome URLs for your site. It has a nice fallback though if you don't have URL rewriting available on your server.
