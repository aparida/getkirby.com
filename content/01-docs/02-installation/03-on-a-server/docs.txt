Title: Installing Kirby on a server

----

Text:

Installing Kirby couldn't be simpler. Just connect to your FTP-Server and **upload all files contained in the Kirby package to the document root of your server â€“ done!**

Visit `http://yourdomain.com` (you should probably replace that with your url :)) and take a look at your brand new, Kirby-flavoured site.
