Text:

## Horizontal Rules

To add a horizontal rule (hr) to your content, just add four asterisks.

```text

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

****

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

```

## Quotes

```text
> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.
> Design is how it works.

– Steve Jobs
```

## Code Blocks

If you want to demonstrate some code, like I do on this page, simply indent the entire code block with a tab:

    <?php

    // awesome code example

    ?>



## Twitter Profile Links

Linking to Twitter profiles has become almost as important as linking to your own website. Thus Kirby provides a simple way to link to any Twitter profile.

```text

(\twitter: getkirby)

```

With link text:

```text

(\twitter: getkirby text: Follow Kirby on Twitter)

```

## Embedding Github Gists

(link: http://github.com text: Github) is probably the most awesome platform for all developers and sharing pieces of code with a (link: http://gist.github.com text: Github Gist) is fantastic. Those Gists can be embedded in any page as easy as it is to embed a Youtube video.

```text
(\gist: https://gist.github.com/2556891)
```

Define, which file you want to embed

```text
(\gist: https://gist.github.com/2556891 file: targetblank.js)
```

## Markdown Extra

If you still need more features, you can switch to (link: http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/ text: Markdown Extra), which is also included with Kirby.

Switching it on is easy. Go to `site/config/config.php` and set

```php
c::set('markdown.extra', true);
```
