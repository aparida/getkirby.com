## Relative links

To link to any page of your site, you can simply use relative links without typing the entire URL. This will make sure, links won't break when you move your site to a different domain or when you are testing your site locally.

```text
(\link: docs/getting-started)
(\link: blog/text-formatting-101)
```

## Email Addresses

Kirby will automatically encrypt your email addresses, so they won't be that easy to be parsed and misused by spam bots.
