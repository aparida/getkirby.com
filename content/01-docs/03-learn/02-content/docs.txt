Title: Creating content

----

Text:

All the content of your site is located in the `content` folder â€“ who would have thought that :)

I've setup a very basic demo content structure for you, so you will hopefully find it easier to get started by modifying existing text files and folders or by adding new ones.

The entire structure inside the content folder is identical to the structure of your site.

For example if you have an "about-us" folder insider your content folder, your site will automatically have an "about-us" page:

```text
    http://yourdomain.com/about-us
```

You can put as many subfolders inside of folders as you like to build the structure of your site. Just take a closer look at the existing structure and browse your site to get an idea of it.
