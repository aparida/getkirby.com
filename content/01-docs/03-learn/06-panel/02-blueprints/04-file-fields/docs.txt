Title: File Fields

----

Text: 

If you want to add meta information to your files you can setup file fields in each blueprint. Those file fields will appear in the file edit form:

To define file fields, simply add them to your blueprints like this: 

```

# default blueprint

title: Page
pages: true
files: true
fields:
  title: 
    label: Title
    type:  text
  text: 
    label: Text
    type:  textarea
    size:  large
filefields: 
  caption: 
    label: Caption
    type:  text 

```

So far there are two available field types: `text` and `textarea`. Please refer to the (link: docs/panel/blueprints/field-types text: field types) section for more information.
