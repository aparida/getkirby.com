Title: User accounts

----

Text:

During the installation process you already setup the first user account. You can setup more accounts very easily. (Please follow the installation steps first if you haven't yet)

## Adding a new account

Go to `site/panel/accounts` and duplicate an exisiting account file. Rename the file to match your username.

Here are some examples:

```php
username: peter => filename: peter.php
username: paul  => filename: paul.php
username: mary  => filename: mary.php
```

You must only use the following characters for usernames: `a-z0-9_-`

Open your new account file in your favorite editor and change the credentials:

```php
username: yourusername
password: yourpassword
language: en
```

### Language

The Kirby panel has built-in language support for English and German. Set language: to `en` or `de` to set the interface-language for the user.

### Password encryption

By default account files use plain passwords. If you want to use encrypted passwords instead, you can do it like this:

#### SHA1

```php
username: yourusername
password: be1109d4a1ba36a23733c30a23f3428fd0c2ed7d
encrypt:  sha1
language: en
```

#### MD5

```php
username: yourusername
password: 0cbc6611f5540bd0809a388dc95a615b
encrypt:  md5
language: en
```

## Custom fields

You are free to add your own fields to store with each account

```php
username: yourusername
password: yourpassword
language: en
email:    mail@testaccount.com
name:     John Doe
phone:    444-1234
```
