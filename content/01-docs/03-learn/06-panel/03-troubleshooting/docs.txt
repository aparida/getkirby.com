Title: Troubleshooting

----

Text:

##File Permissions

The Panel must be able to edit, move and delete your files and folders inside your content folder. So please make sure that all folders are set to `0755` and your files are set to `0666`.

##Missing Blueprints

Whenever you login to the Panel you will get a warning when there are templates for your site, which don't have a corresponding blueprint. Please add a blueprint to get rid of that warning.

##Uploads

If you are not allowed to upload a specific file, please make sure that the folder is writable, the file is not too big and it has an allowed mime type.

### Allowing more mime types

By default there are only a few mime types allowed to be uploaded. Go to `site/panel/config/config.php` to add additional mime types.

### Thumbnails for uploaded images

Kirby will automatically try to generate thumbnails for your uploaded images. If this fails, it will use the original files to display a preview in the file browser. This can influence loading times, when you've uploaded huge images.

To make sure that Kirby is able to generate thumbnails, please add a `thumbs` folder to the main directory of your Kirby site and make it writable.
