Title: Helpers

Text:

To make your life as a template developer even easier, there are some handy helper functions

### url($uri)

If you want to echo a page url in your templates without using an absolute url you can use the url() function like this:

```php

<?php echo url('projects/project-1') ?>

```

It will take care of always returning the right absolute url.
If you need it even shorter, go for:

```php

<?php echo u('projects/project-1') ?>

```

### thisURL()

Sometimes it's nice to get the current url without much hassle. That's what thisURL() is for:

```php

<?php echo thisURL() ?>

```

### home()

Redirects the user to the homepage

```php

<?php home() ?>

```

### notFound()

Redirects the user to the error page

```php

<?php notFound() ?>

```

### css($url, $media='all')

This is just a shortcut for your templates to easily embed stylesheet files:

```php

<?php echo css('styles/styles.css') ?>

```

You can also use this with absolute urls

```php

<?php echo css('http://example.com/some/styles.css') ?>

```

### js($url)

This is another shortcut for your templates to easily embed javascript files:

```php

<?php echo js('javascript/jquery.js') ?>

```

You can also use this with absolute urls

```php

<?php echo js('http://example.com/some/scripts.js') ?>

```
