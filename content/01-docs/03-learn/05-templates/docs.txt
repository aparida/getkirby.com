Title: Building Templates

----

Text:

## Default template

All the templates for your site are located in `site/templates`. You will find a `default.php` in there, which is used for every page without a specific template.

## Page specific templates

If you already read the chapter about (link: docs/content text: adding content) you might remember that the content file for the homepage was called `home.txt`.

Let's say we want to build a specific template for our homepage. All we need to do is to add a new `home.php` file to the `site/templates` folder and define our specific html for the homepage there.

This makes it very easy to create your own templates for any page without any further setup. As long as you don't add a page-specific file, the `default.php` will be used.

To use the same template for other pages, just give the text file for that page the same name.
