Embedding asset files ain't nothing but a peanut with Kirby. Have a look at the following options!


## Shorthand loading of CSS and JS files

The easiest way to embed single asset files is to use the shortcut helpers:

```
<?php echo css('assets/css/main.css') ?>
<?php echo js('assets/js/jquery.js') ?>
```

The output will be:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://yourdomain.com/assets/css/main.css" />
<script src="http://yourdomain.com/assets/js/jquery.js"></script>
```


## Loading multiple asset files

You can use simple arrays to fetch multiple asset files if you need to.

```
<?php css(array(
      'assets/css/reset.css',
      'assets/css/main.css',
      'assets/css/ie.css'
)); ?>
```

Feel free to do the same with JavaScript files:

```
<?php js(array(
      'assets/css/jquery.js',
      'assets/css/slider.js'
)); ?>
```

## Loading template specific asset files

The following CSS file will only be loaded if the corresponding template is used. That works with JS files as well.

```
<?php echo css('@auto') ?>
```

Make sure to name your asset file equally to your template file!
