Title: Site Variable ($site)

----

Text: 

The site variable is the mother of all variables in Kirby. It's a huge object which contains everything else. You will find more about this later, but the most important parts for your templates are: 

## Site Title

```php

<?php echo $site->title() ?>

```

This is defined in `content/site.txt` and you can use that to set the global name of your site and probably use it for the title tag in your templates. 

## Site Description 

```php

<?php echo $site->description() ?>

```

This is defined in `content/site.txt` as well and will hold the description for your description meta tag.

## Site Keywords

```php

<?php echo $site->keywords() ?>

```

Well, that one is defined in `content/site.txt` again and I guess you know what you can do with that :)

## Modified

```php

<?php echo $site->modified() ?>

```

Returns the date and time of the site’s most recent modification.

## Your own global Site Variables

In general all the fields you define in the `content/site.txt` file will be available that way. So if you define a field for copyright for example:

    Copyright: John Doe
    ----


You can access it in your templates like this: 

```php

<?php echo $site->copyright() ?>

```

BTW: Field names will always be converted to lowercase variables. 

## URI

The site variable also contains an URI object, which has some nice information about the current url, path and query.
