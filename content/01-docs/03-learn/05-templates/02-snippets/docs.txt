Title: Snippets

----

Text:

Before we move on with stuff you can add to your templates I want to talk about snippets first. Snippets are little pieces of html, which you can re-use in any template. Snippets help you keeping your templates organized. They are located in `site/snippets`. You can add as many as you want/need.

## Embedding snippets in your templates

Embedding them in your templates is something your grandma could do.
If your snippet file is called `mysnippet.php` simply embed it in your templates like this:

```php

<?php snippet('mysnippet') ?>

```


**You can even embed snippets inside of snippets. How cool is that?**

You will find a bunch of demo snippets inside `site/snippets`, which you can use for your own templates. I plan to have a shared snippet repository later, where everybody can take part and upload their own snippets.

## Passing variables to snippets

Sometimes you might need to pass some variables from your template to a snippet or from a snippet to a deeper embedded snippet. No big deal! In your template you pass variables to your snippets like this:

```php

<?php

$myvar = 'My Super Awesome Var';

snippet('mysnippet', array('myvar' => $myvar));

?>

```

â€¦and in `mysnippet.php` you can access them like this:

```php

<?php

echo $myvar;
// should echo: 'My Super Awesome Var'

?>

```
