Title: Images

## Images in your content folder

You can easily embed any images from your page's content folder.

```text
(\image: myawesomepicture.jpg)
```

Set the width and height of an image

```text
(\image: myawesomepicture.jpg width: 120 height: 200)
```

Define an alternative text for an image

```text
(\image: myawesomepicture.jpg alt: On this picture you can see a cat)
```

Sometimes you need to add floating or special styling to particular images. Best way to do this is to go for a custom css class.

```text
(\image: myawesomepicture.jpg class: floated)
```

A linked image

```text
(\image: myawesomepicture.jpg link: http://flickr.com)
```

You can even link to the same picture – maybe for a lightbox feature – or to a different picture in the same content folder.

```text
(\image: myawesomepicture.jpg link: anothergreatpic.jpg)
```

## Images from other websites

To embed images from other websites, simply use the direct URL to the image. Please make sure you got the copyright and the permission to deep-link to an external image!

```text
(\image: http://flickr.com/someimage.jpg)
```

Of course all the additional attributes, described above, are available for external images as well.
