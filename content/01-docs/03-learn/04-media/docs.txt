Title: Adding media

----

Text:

Kirby makes it super easy to add images, documents or videos to your pages. Simply drop them into the folder for each page like this:

(image: 01.png)

You can sort files by prepending those numbers again. I recommend just using numbers instead of filenames. This makes it much easier to keep stuff tidy.

Kirby will automatically fetch all those images, videos and docs and you can later add them to your templates or content in seconds.

## Adding files to your content

Kirby has built-in tags, which you can use to embed images in your content or to link to downloadable files. (link: docs/formatting-text text: Read more about them…)

## Adding files to your templates

Kirby has an array of methods to make it easy to include all images and files in your templates. (link: docs/variables/media text: Read more about them…)


## Thumbnails

Kirby has no built-in image resizer by default, but there's the (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/thumb-plugin text: Thumb plugin), which will create resized images for you on the fly.

If you prefer to work with your own thumbnails upload them to your page folders like this:

Similar to the image info text files, Kirby will automatically attach them to the original images and you can access them in your templates very easily:

```

<?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg') ?>

<a href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>"><img src="<?php echo $image->thumb()->url() ?>" /></a>

```

## Recalculating Image Sizes

Though there is no real image resizer, all image objects in Kirby have built-in recalculation of image sizes. You won't get a smaller file, but you can still embed your images into your site with different sizes. Here are some examples:

### Fit the image into a box of 200x200 pixel

```

<?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg')->fit(200) ?>

<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" width="<?php echo $image->width() ?>" height="<?php echo $image->height() ?>" />

```

### Make the image 200px width

```

<?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg')->fitWidth(200) ?>

<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" width="<?php echo $image->width() ?>" height="<?php echo $image->height() ?>" />

```

### Make the image 200px height

```

<?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg')->fitHeight(200) ?>

<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" width="<?php echo $image->width() ?>" height="<?php echo $image->height() ?>" />

```
