Title: Multi-language sites

----

Text:

Since Version 1.1 Kirby has full built-in multi-language support. You are able to translate each and every part of your website with a few simple steps.

## Getting started

Jump to your config file `site/config/config.php` and activate multi-language support there:

```php

c::set('lang.support', true);
c::set('lang.default', 'en');
c::set('lang.available', array('en', 'de'));
c::set('lang.detect', true);

```

If you are still using an older version of Kirby, please upgrade and add those lines to your existing config file.

As soon as you activate multi-language support, Kirby will automatically create new language-specific URLs for your site:
