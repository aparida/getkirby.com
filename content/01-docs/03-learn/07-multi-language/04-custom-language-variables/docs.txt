Title: Custom language variables

----

Text:

When working with multi-language site projects, you often run into the problem of needing language-specific variables. Simple things like translated button labels for your contact form for example or other translatable parts, which don't need to be administrated by editors.

For such a case, Kirby has a built in language variable management.
Simply add a new `languages` folder to your `site` folder and insert a PHP file with the specific language shortcode for each available language:

#### site/languages
(image: 01.png)

In those files, you can define translatable variables like this:

#### en.php
```php
<?php

l::set('mybutton', 'My awesome button');

?>
```

#### de.php
```php
<?php

l::set('mybutton', 'Mein schÃ¶ner Knopf');

?>
```

Those translated variables can be used in any template, plugin or snippet:

#### sites/templates/default.php
```

<input type="submit" value="<?php echo l::get('mybutton') ?>" />

```
