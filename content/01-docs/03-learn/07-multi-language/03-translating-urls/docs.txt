Title: Translating URLs

----

Text:

I put a lot of effort to create nice URLs with Kirby. Something like:

```
http://yourdomain.com/projects/project-a
```

This is more readable for your visitors and also for search engines.

But when you are working with a multi-language site project you will be facing the problem, that those URLs should somehow be translatable.

```
http://yourdomain.com/projekte/projekt-a
```

So what you can do with mulit-language support activated is to add a new field to your content files, to provide a translation for the URL.

Here's a quick example – English is the default language:

#### content/projects/projects.en.txt

    title: My Title
    ----
    text: This is the text for the projects page

#### content/projects/projects.de.txt

    title: Mein Titel
    ----
    URL-Key: projekte
    ----
    text: Das ist der Text für die Projekt Seite

The URL for the English translation will be:

```
http://yourdomain.com/en/projects
```

and the URL for the German translation will be:

```
http://yourdomain.com/de/projekte
```

You don't need to add `URL-Key` to your text files for your default language. Kirby will take the folder name in that case.
