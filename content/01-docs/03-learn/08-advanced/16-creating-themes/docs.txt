Title: Creating Kirby Themes

----

Text: 

A great starting point to create themes for Kirby is Kirby's blank theme. It comes with nothing but the essentials â€“ no predefined content, no assets, no plugins, even no templates and snippets. 

## Blank theme repository

The blank theme's Git repository can be found at: 
<https://github.com/getkirby-themes/blank>

## Clone the blank theme:

I recommend you use the following Git workflow to create a clone of the blank theme. 
This workflow makes it possible to create multiple themes instead of just forking one. 

Open the terminal and cd to the parent directory of your theme. i.e.:

```
cs ~/Sites/kirby/themes
```

Clone the blank repository:

```

git clone https://github.com/getkirby-themes/blank.git yourtheme

```

Replace `yourtheme` with the name of your theme

Create a new empty repository in your Github account and name it accordingly. 

Rename the `origin` to `upstream`:

```

git remote rename origin upstream

```

Add your new repository as origin:

```

git remote add origin https://github.com/youraccount/yourtheme.git

```

Push to your origin for the first time and set it as default. 

```

git push -u origin master

```

You can now make changes to your new theme and push them to your Github repository. 

### Submodules

To fetch all required submodules for your local installation of your theme, you can do:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

```
