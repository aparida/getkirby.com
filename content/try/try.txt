Title: Try Kirby before you buy it
----
Text: 

I want you to be happy with Kirby first, before you buy a license.
This is why (link: http://github.com/getkirby text: Kirby's source code) is fully available without limitations. I like to call it commercial open-source. 

Try it **locally** or install it on a **non-public staging server** and give it a spin as long as you want.
