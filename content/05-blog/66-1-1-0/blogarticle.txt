I've been working on many different things in the last weeks and I'm happy to finally release (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/tree/dev text: Kirby 1.1.0 ) and also (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/tree/dev text: Panel 0.8)

## Kirby 1.1.0

### Multi-Language Support

I've already (link: blog/multilang-preview text: released a preview) for the new multi-language site version of Kirby in April and I'm thrilled that this is now available out of the box in Kirby 1.1.0.

Building multi-language site projects is often a very complicated task and I've tried to make this as easy as possible with Kirby. Basically Kirby will take care about everything:

- nice, language specific URLs
- easy content translation with dedicated text files for each language
- automatic fallbacks for missing translations
- super easy language switching and auto language detection
- translatable file meta information
- custom translatable variables
- (link: docs/multi-language text: and much moreâ€¦)

### Auto Subfolder Detection

Running Kirby in a subfolder of your domain always required a few additional steps for the installation. Kirby 1.1.0 has built-in auto subfolder detection. This makes installing Kirby a breeze on most servers, since you probably won't need to change anything. In some cases you still might need to change your htaccess file, but this will be way more simple to do. 

### Changeable content file extensions

By default all Kirby content files got `txt` as extension, but you can now change this to use `md` or `mdown` or whatever extension you prefer. 

#### site/config/config.php
```php

c::set('content.file.extension', 'md');

``` 

### Better Plugin System

Thanks to (twitter: vis7mac text: Lukas) there's now an improved plugin system. So far all main plugin files had to be directly in the site/plugins folder, which got messed up pretty quickly. Now you can have a dedicated plugin folder for each plugin.

This approach is way cleaner and you get the chance to save readme files together with your plugins and also have additional subfolders for plugins. 

To check for activated plugins you can now ask for them with a new method: 

```php

if($site->hasPlugin('twitter')) {
  echo 'The Twitter plugin is available';
}

```

### Better .htaccess file

The new version also includes a better .htaccess file, which has built-in protection for your content text files and files in your site folder. It also includes the rewrite rules for the panel, so you can make changes in just one place instead of two. 

### Relative URLs

Many of you have asked for a way to setup Kirby with relative instead of absolute URLs. With 1.1.0 it's now possible with a simple change in your config: 

```php
c::set('url', '/');
```

## Panel 0.8

With the brand new Kirby version you also need to install the latest Panel version, which comes with many new updates. 

### Multi-Language Support

The new Panel version supports all translatable parts of Kirby: 

- translate content
- translate site info
- translate URLs
- translate file meta information

The Panel will automatically notice when you got Multi-Language Support activated and provides a language switch. 

### Language Labels

When translating content, it can be tricky to keep track of which language you are currently working on. The Panel now has built-in language labels next to all form labels, so you can always be sure to translate the right thing.

### Translatable Form Labels

The new Panel version is available in (link: docs/panel/translations text: 11 languages): 

- English
- German
- Dutch
- French
- Turkish
- Rumanian
- Spanish
- Hungarian
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Finnish

Additionally to those interface translations, you can now translate your own form fields, which you setup in blueprints: 

```
fields:
  title: 
    label: 
      en: Title
      de: Titel
    type: text
```

You can even translate help texts for your editors: 

```
fields:
  title: 
    label: 
      en: Title
      de: Titel
    type: text
    help: 
      en: Please enter a title
      de: Bitte geben Sie einen Titel ein
```
