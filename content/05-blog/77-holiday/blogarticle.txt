The last months have been fantastic! I've launched Kirby in January and your feedback and reactions have exceeded my expectations by far. I couldn't be more thankful for the great community that has already formed around Kirby and I hope it will go on like this. 

**YOU GUYS ROCK!**

But it's time to take a break. So I just wanted to let you know that I won't be available for support or feedback in the next two weeks. I'm leaving for vacation tomorrow and will be back on September 24th. 

Please use the (link: forum text: forum) in the meantime to help each other. 

See you on the other side.
