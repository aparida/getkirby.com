What is the most awesome thing about the web? Links! 
Everything can be linked and set in relation and this is fantastic. 

With Kirby there are already a few easy ways to link information on your site with external or internal sources, but in fact there's no built-in way to set relations between pages in Kirby â€“ no longer!

With the new (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/related text: Related) plugin, it's now possible to add any number of related pages to any page in Kirby. 

This can be super useful to add related articles to blog posts. If you build a shop-like website you can easily link to related products or projects or you could simply add other related pages, which somehow contain helpful information for your visitors. There are numerous examples of great stuff you can build with page relations. 

## Installation

Installing the plugin is super easy. Download the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/plugins/related/related.php text: related.php) and add it to your `site/plugins` folder.

## How to use it

### In your content files

Add a new field to any of your content files, which you'd like to add related pages to: 

    Title: My Title
    ----
    Text: Some text for this page
    ----
    Related: 
    
    - projects/project-1
    - blog/my-related-blog-article
    - press


You are free to name the field with related pages however you like, as long as you take care of using the right variable in the template later. 

Add any number of related pages with the simple list syntax. To link pages, you simply use the URI of them (the URL without your domain) Since the URI is unique, Kirby will always be able to find the right page, even if you change the content or the sorting number of it. You only need to be careful if you change the location of a page or its folder name. 

### In your templates

To access related pages in your templates you can call the new `related()` function:

```

<?php snippet('header') ?>

<h1><?php echo html($page->title()) ?></h1>
<?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>

<h2>Related:</h2>
<ul>
  <?php foreach(related($page->related()) as $related): ?>
  <li><a href="<?php echo $related->url() ?>"><?php echo html($related->title()) ?></a></li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>

```

This is just a very simple example, but the result of `related()` is actually very mighty. It contains a full set of `$pages` with a full `$page` object for each related page. This means that you can do all the stuff, which you would normally do with a set of `$pages` and a single `$page` object. You can find more about that in the (link: http://cl.ly/GXBe text: Kirby Cheat Sheet)

Here are some more examples: 

```

<?php 

$related = related($page->related());

// show the url of the first related page
echo $related->first()->url();

// show the title of the last related page  
echo $related->last()->title();

// limit the number of related items
foreach($related->flip()->limit(5) as $related) {
  // do something 
}

?>

```

You can even access the children of related pages: 

```

<?php 

$related = related($page->related());

// access the children of the first related page
foreach($related->first()->children() as $relatedChild) {
  echo $relatedChild->title();
}

?>

```

As you can see, this can be very, very powerful. 

I hope you enjoy this new plugin and it will help you to build more cool stuff. Let me knwo when you got feedback and please make sure to send me examples, when you created something awesome with it :) <bastian@getkirby.com>
