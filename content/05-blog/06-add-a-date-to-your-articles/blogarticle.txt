Our blog is already pretty nice, but there's one more major things missing: a date for each article. 

Kirby has a built in feature to include dates in your contents. 
You could always add a simple field to your content files and write a date their just like this:

    Title: Super Nice Content
    ----
    SomeDate: 15/12/2011
    ----

…and afterwards in your template you could just parse that date with PHP and generate whatever you need:

```php
<?php

$somedate = strtotime($page->somedate());

echo date('Y-m-d', $somedate);
// 2011-12-15

?>
```
    
**But there's a nicer way to do that!**

Whenever you need a date for your content, just add a date field to your content file:

    Title: Super Nice Content
    ----
    Date: 15/12/2011
    ----
    
Make sure the format you use for your date is parsable by php. Anything like `dd/mm/YYYY` or `YYYY-mm-dd` or many other formats will do. Read more about it (link: http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php text:here). 

`Date` is a predefined keyword, so Kirby will automatically take care of parsing the content of that field as a date and give you nice shortcuts to handle it in your templates.

```php    
<?php echo $page->date('Y-m-d') ?>
```

This will do the same as the example above – just in one line. As an argument you can pass any valid (link: http://php.net/manual/de/function.date.php text: php date format string). If you don't pass any string the function will return a unix timestamp, which you can use to make some more fancy php date calculation stuff. 

## How to use that for our blog?

So if we take a look at our blog article template, it is very easy to include a date there and this is just a very general example. 

```
<article>
  <h1><?php echo html($article->title()) ?></h1>
  <?php echo kirbytext($article->text()) ?>

  <time datetime="<?php echo $page->date('c') ?>" pubdate="pubdate"><?php echo $page->date('d.m.Y H:i') ?></time>

</article>

```

It's up to you to customize that and build your own perfect article template. I'm sure you come up with something way more creative than that :)
