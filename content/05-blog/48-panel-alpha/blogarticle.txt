Text: I got a lot of positive feedback for Kirby so far and a lot of that feedback included that you would love to use Kirby for client projects but most of your clients won't be able to use it without a web-based admin interface. 

So today I'm super excited to start a public alpha for the official **(link: panel text: Kirby Admin Panel)**.

The Panel is a **free open-source add-on** to the Kirby CMS core. It's built in a very modular way, so you can decide if you want to use it for your Kirby project or not at any time. It's packed in one single folder, so you can always add it to new or existing Kirby projects and you can also remove it at any time without harming your site. 

Here are some main features of the Panel:

### Add/Update/Delete 

The Panel offers full control of all your content and files. 

### Supports any content structure

All forms in the Panel can be fully customized to fit the content structure of your site. 

### Very Lightweight

I've put all energy in keeping things simple and small. The entire source for the Panel is under 1 MB so you don't get a bloated system. 

### No Branding

The Panel does not come with a huge Kirby logo and Kirby branding, which you have to remove for your client projects. It has a very reduced design with one adjustable primary color and no extra logo. It will fit to your client branding in seconds. 

### Drag & Drop Sorting

Sorting your pages with drag & drop is super handy. Your clients will never have to worry about numbers in front of folders. 

### Multiple Accounts

You can setup as many accounts for your Panel as you need. 

### FTP + Panel = Love

Installing the Panel does not mean that you have to give up control via FTP. You can still upload files and edit content with your favorite FTP client and all will be synced in the Panel instantly.
