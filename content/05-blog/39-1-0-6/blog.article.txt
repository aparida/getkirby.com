Text: (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: 1.0.6) is here.
It's a minor release with a bug fix for entirely numeric folder names, like `2012` or `1234`. Those did not work with the `$pages->find()` method in earlier releases. 

I also included the rel attribute for kirbytext link tags:

	(\link: http://google.com rel: nofollow)



## How to update?

Download the **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: latest version)** and extract the ZIP. Remove the old kirby system folder from your site and replace it with the new one from the latest version.

**Also make sure to empty your cache folder if you have caching enabled**
