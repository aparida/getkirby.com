Last Wednesday my wife and I received the best christmas gift ever: our little son was born! It's by far the most amazing thing that has ever happened to us and the most exciting time in our lifes.

I hope you understand that we both want to spend as much time with him as possible and that I won't be available to reply to all your emails immediately in the next weeks. 

I wish you all a very happy Christmas with your families. 
See you in January!

Cheers, 
Bastian
