Another week, another minor release. There has still been a tiny bug in the sortBy() method for pages and files. It all worked well unless you were trying to sort dates. I double and tripple checked and it's working fine now. Sorry for that. 

Download the latest version **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: here)**.

## What's new?

I took the chance to include some cool new feature requests in this release:

### Extendable Kirbytext

(twitter: nerdismus) asked if it would be possible to extend the kirbytext class so you could add your own (link: docs/formatting-text text: text formatting) tags. That's actually a very good suggestion and so I made the kirbytext class extendable. 

I will write a more detailed article about how to extend kirbytext soon, but you can find a quick example over at Github: <https://gist.github.com/1662410>

### filterBy()

I was asked by a bunch of users if it would be possible to filter a list of pages by the value of a certain field. Right now you could use i.e.…

```php
$page->children->findBy('title', 'Contact');
```

…but it would only return a single page. You can use the new filterBy method now, which will return a set of pages, which match the given value. 

```php

// filter the main pages
$pages->filterBy('category', 'design');

// filter any subpages
$pages->find('projects')->children()->filterBy('category', 'design');

// filter subpages of the current page
$page->children()->filterBy('draft', 'yes');

```

But the best thing about this new method is, that you can also use it to filter by a keyword, which is contained in a comma separated field value. 

Especially if you want to add multiple tags or keywords for each article in a blog or projects in a portfolio, you can now do something like this:

	Title: Some title
	----
	Tags: design, fun, photography
	----
	Text: Some text
	----

This is how you get a list of all pages with the tag `design`:

```php

$result = $page->children()->filterBy('tags', 'design', ','); 

foreach($result as $row) {
  // do something fancy with that page here
}

```

The third argument for filterBy determines the character, which Kirby will use to split the field value to build a list. So you could also write your list of values like this:

	Keywords: app | fun | nice | whatever

… and fetch the results like this …

```php

$result = $page->children()->filterBy('keywords', 'fun', '|'); 

```

I've used this new feature to build the tag filter for this blog. I will write a new article about this together with a tutorial how to build a tagcloud next. 

### param()

There's an article about all the things you can do with the (link: blog/the-mighty-mighty-uri-object text: URI object of Kirby) and one thing is to access those params (that's how I call them) in URLs: 

	http://yourdomain.com/somepage/param1:value1/param2:value2

Until now you could get the value of those params like this:

```php

echo $site->uri->params('param1');
// will echo: value1

echo $site->uri->params('param2');
// will echo: value2

```

In the new version you get a shortcut for this, so all you need to write is:

```php

echo param('param1');
// will echo: value1

echo param('param2');
// will echo: value2

```

## How to update?

Download the latest version **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: here)**.
Replace your old kirby system folder with the new kirby system folder from the download. 

If you are already running your site in production, you should make a backup of your old kirby folder so you can roll back anytime if something goes wrong.
