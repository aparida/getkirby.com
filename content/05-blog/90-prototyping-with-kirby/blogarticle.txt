I just returned from (link: http://beyondtellerrand.com text: beyond tellerrand) conference, which is easily Germany's best web conference. It was packed with an amazing line-up and fantastic talks with a variety of topics, but one topic really stood out for me: 

**Stop designing websites in Photoshop.**
**Learn HTML & CSS and design in the browser.** 

This advice was not just given in one talk, but in an entire series of talks and it's an advice I wholeheartedly agree with. This is the perfect time to learn HTML and CSS and thus learn how to build your own prototypes. I started designing all my work in the browser about four years ago and it still has a huge effect on all of my projects. 

Designers often are afraid to take this step and yet it will help you to come up with better results more quickly. HTML & CSS is not rocket science and how to build websites is probably one of the best documented skills on the web. 

I think in this time it's super important to help other designers take this step and give them the chance to move their coding skills forward. We all can benefit from the results, right? 

It's just a small thing, but **that's why I decided to make Kirby entirely free for all prototyping work,** as I'm sure it can be really helpful to speed up the development/prototyping process for any web designer. 

No matter if you are working on a commercial project or on a private prototype; no matter if you are a freelancer or an agency; no matter if your prototype is for a Kirby-powered website or you plan to move to another CMS for production; no matter if you run it locally or install it on a staging server to show the prototype to your clients; no matter if you have one or one hundred prototypes – it's free!

PS: Just (link: buy text: make sure to buy a license) as soon as you go live with your prototype.
