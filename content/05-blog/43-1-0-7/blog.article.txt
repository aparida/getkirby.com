This version improves performance for older PHP versions and also fixes the "Too deep object nesting" bug. 

It also includes an updated .htaccess version, which is no longer a binary file to avoid permission problems on some servers. It also contains a new section of recommended, optional htaccess values. 

## Flipping files

The new version also includes a new `->flip()` method for files. flip() has always been available for pages and is very handy if you want to reverse the order of a set of pages. Now you can do the same with files. I.e. 

```php

// get all files for the current page in reverse order
$files = $page->files()->flip();

// get all images for the current page in reverse order
$image = $page->images()->flip();

```

## How to update?

Download the **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: latest version)** and extract the ZIP. Remove the old kirby system folder from your site and replace it with the new one from the latest version.

**Also make sure to empty your cache folder if you have caching enabled**
