Every now and then people send me links to their websites, which they built with Kirby and I absolutely love that! It's the biggest reward for my work to see all the fantastic (link: made-with-kirby-and-love text: projects that have been created with Kirby) so far. 

Today I woke up to find another one of those (link: http://twitter.com/fitzage/status/243557372629491713 text: links) in my Twitter stream and it just blew my mind. **(link: http://joyent.com text: Joyent's new website is built with Kirby!)**

(link: http://joyent.com text: Joyent) is one of the leading cloud hosting companies and has such amazing clients as LinkedIn or Adobe. 

But as happy as I am to know that Joyent trusts in Kirby and uses it for their website, as impressed I am about the work they put into their site. 

It's probably the most complex and complete Kirby project so far, with hundreds of subpages, dozens of different templates and data sets and a superb responsive design. 

I couldn't wish for any better use case for Kirby. All its flexibility is shown here. So make sure to check out their site and see how they use Kirby by every trick in the book. 

Thanks to (twitter: fitzage text: Matthew Fitzsimmons) and the entire team at Joyent for trusting in Kirby and a special "thank you" to Matthew for becoming a regular feedback and idea provider and probably the most active user in the (link: forum text: Kirby Forum) :)
