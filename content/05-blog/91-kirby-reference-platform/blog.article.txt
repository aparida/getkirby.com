I already mentioned in an earlier post that I plan to create much better documentation for Kirby 2. That's one reason why the entire project takes so long. I really want you to understand all the code that is behind it. I think this is essential for any web developer to feel really comfortable with a content management system. It guarantees that you are always in control of your projects and the system itself and you won't run into any unanticipated, unsolvable problems during a client project. 

Today I'm really excited to launch a developer preview for the new 
**(link: http://reference.new.getkirby.com text: Kirby Reference Platform).**

This platform is an addition to the docs section on this site. It's not so much intended as a place where you find how-tos, but a place where you can find every little bolt and gear that is involved when running a Kirby-powered site. Every class, method, function, constant, helper and variable is documented there. 

It's not just a reference for the new Kirby CMS, but as well for the new Kirby Toolkit, the new Kirby Panel and the brand-new Kirby App Framwork. 

As I mentioned it's a developer preview. I'm still very actively working on the code for all those new components and things will definitely change. But I wanted you to have a look at this as early as possible to be able to give feedback and let me know if this works for you or not. 

I plan to add more code examples and comments in the next days and I still need to write more detailed instructions how to work with Kirby's repositories on Github. 

So if you got any kind of feedback, please let me know: <bastian@getkirby.com>

## A couple insights

The reference platform is of course running on Kirby 2. I wrote a library, which extracts all kinds of documentation from the actual source code of Kirby 2 and builds the content structure and all the text files out of it. This makes it possible to write the documentation only once – in the source – and update the platform for every new release with just a click. After considering a bunch of ready-made code documentation tools, this seemed the most powerful solution to me, which I will always be able to extend in the future and design in a way I think fits best. 

The entire site is responsive, so you can read the docs on any mobile device. It's not perfect yet, but getting there. I'm also making use of a new font, which I'm pretty fond of right now – no pun intended :) It's Adobe's Source Sans Pro, which in my opinion is a fantastic web font. It totally adds to the readability of the docs and will also be the brand font for Kirby 2.
