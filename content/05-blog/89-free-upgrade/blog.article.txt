In the last two weeks after releasing my (link: blog/sneak-peek text: Kirby 2 Sneak Peek) I had to learn 
an interesting lesson: 

*Never tell people about an upcoming major release of your software, 
if you still want to sell your current version.*

I didn't write about the upgrade modalities of Kirby 2 for existing Kirby users, 
so sales went down massively – actually close to zero. 

So let me make it clear: **Kirby 2 will be a free upgrade for all existing users!**

I always had planned to make the upgrade free. I don't believe in penalizing existing users. I want you to be as happy with Kirby as possible and thus use it for upcoming projects as well. I believe in long-term relationships. That's why the license model of Kirby is built on trust, and that's why the upgrade model will always be fair as well. 

I'm considering an additional price for the panel though. I'm not decided yet, but the new version might be worth enough to not make it entirely free. 

So with my promise of free upgrades, it's a huge chance to buy Kirby now and get the panel for free for that license, even if I decide to set a price for it later – just sayin' … :)
