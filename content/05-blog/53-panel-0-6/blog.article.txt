Text: 

It's been a while since the first (link: blog/panel-alpha text: Kirby Panel Alpha) has been released and I'm very happy about all the help and positive feedback. Today I'm releasing the **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel text: next alpha version)**. There are still a few missing features for 1.0, but I feel the beta is getting closer. 

Please understand that not all suggestions from testers are in this next release. You guys had a bunch of awesome ideas, but the entire process of testing and coming up with the first version of the panel is taking longer than expected and I try to get it done finally. 

## Download

You can (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel text: download the latest version from Github)

## How to update

I always try to make updating as simple as possible. What you need to do, is to replace the old panel folder with the new panel folder. If you have modified the .htaccess inside the panel folder, make sure to not replace that one. 

## Docs

For all Panel testers, I've setup the first version of the (link: panel text: Panel docs). Please let me know if something is not understandable or missing. 

## What's new

A lot of fixes, new features and translations have gone into this new release. 

### Format Buttons

For all textareas, you can now activate the new format buttons in blueprints. 

(image: 01.png)

To activate them, add `buttons: true` to the textarea field definition in your blueprints. Here's an example, how to configure a textarea with buttons in a blueprint:

```

fields:
  text: 
    label:   Text
    type:    textarea
    size:    large
    buttons: true

```

You can even list individual buttons if you don't want to provide access to all of them:

```

fields:
  text: 
    label: Text
    type:  textarea
    size:  large
    buttons: 
      - h1
      - h2
      - bold
      - italic

```


### Input validation

It's now possible to specify required fields and also do some input validation. This is again setup in your blueprints together with field definitions.

#### Required fields

```

fields:
  text: 
    label:    Text
    type:     textarea
    size:     large
    required: true
	
```

#### Validation

If you want to make sure that the content of a field is validated before a page can be saved, you can use the new validate option for fields. 

```

fields:
  email: 
    label:    Email Address
    type:     text
    validate: email
	
```

You can use the predefined validation methods: `email`, `date`, `url` or you can define your own:

```

fields:
  somefield: 
    label:  Some Label
    type:   text
    validate: 
      minlength: 10
      maxlength: 30
      match:     /[a-z0-9]+/i
	
```

minlengt, maxlength and match are all optional, so you can combine them however you want. 

### Running the panel without mod_rewrite

The requirement for mod\_rewrite for the Panel has led to quite some problems, so you can now switch off mod\_rewrite support for the Panel in the Panel config (site/panel/config/config.php)

```php

c::set('panel.rewrite', false);

```

All Panel URLs will be constructed like this afterwards: 

```

http://yourdomain.com/panel/index.php/some/path

```

### IE 8 ready!

The Panel interface will now work 100% on Internet Explorer 8. This will be the oldest supported version of Internet Explorer for Panel Version 1. Depending on the feedback, I might add support for Internet Explorer 7 later. The Panel has also been tested on IE9, latest versions of Opera, Firefox, Safari and Chrome (Win and Mac). If you find any browser-related issues, please let me know. 

The Panel works also great on the iPad, except for sorting pages. I plan to add support for MobileSafari on the iPhone + Webkit on Android and sorting without drag and drop later. 

### Bug Fixes

There are tons of bug fixes in this release. Please check the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/blob/master/changelog.mdown text: changelog.mdown) for more info. 

### Translations

I'm totally overwhelmed by the fantastic support with translations. The Panel is still in Alpha and yet it is available in **nine languages!!** 

A huge "Thank You!!" to: (link: http://morrick.me text: Riccardo Mori), (link: http://www.laggoun.com text: Loubna Aggoun), (link: http://kukac7.hu text: Dávid Bóta), (link: http://www.nirusu.me text: Nils Hendriks), (link: http://seitenwerk.at text: Seitenwerk), (link: http://ciuciu.at text: Ciuciu) and (link: http://seitenwerk.at text: Parlak) for their help.

To change the Panel translation for a certain account, open the account file in site/panel/accounts and change the language code like this:

```

Available codes are 

```

```
