Normally I don't want to release new minor versions every week, but unfortunately 1.0.7 had an annoying bug in the `pages::findBy()` method, which I just had to fix – so sorry about it!!!

To give you some candy for the update I decided to include a new feature, I've been playing with for a while and which I absolutely love – a YAML parser. I will post a tutorial about what it is and what you can do with it a bit later. 

## How to update?

Download the **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: latest version)** and extract the ZIP. Remove the old kirby system folder from your site and replace it with the new one from the latest version.

**Also make sure to empty your cache folder if you have caching enabled**
