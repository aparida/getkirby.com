I've decided to go a new way with Kirby's license. You can try Kirby on your local machine as long as you want and the source is (link: http://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms text: available on Github). But as soon as you want to use Kirby  in production, you must (link: buy text: purchase a license).

You can't stop people stealing your code and I don't want to spend any energy on it at all. 

The additional benefit of hosting the project on Github is huge. 

- Providing updates will be so much easier 
- Github offers an excellent issue tracker and wiki system
- Offering a free trial is the best way for everbody to see if Kirby fits the next project or not. What am I winning, if I trick you into buying a product you don't need?

So I hope you appreciate that way and support me by buying a license.

Cheers, Bastian
