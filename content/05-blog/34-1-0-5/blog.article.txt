(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: 1.0.5) is here and brings some bug fixes and improvements and one main new feature. 
I've been asked by a bunch of users, who wanted to use Kirby as a blog system primarily, if it would be possible to have article URLs without an additional subdirectory in the URL. 

Right now you could add all the articles to a blog folder and got URLs like:

	http://yourblog.com/blog/my-awesome-article

With the new release it is possible to setup your blog as the homepage without that nasty `blog` in the URL:

	http://yourblog.com/my-awesome-article

It takes two steps to set this up:

Create a blog folder and put all your articles in there. 
Go to `site/config/config.php` and setâ€¦

	c::set('home', 'blog');

This will make your new blog folder the source for the homepage. You can delete the old home folder afterwards. All article URLs will still have `blog` in the URL, so we need to add a new line to the .htaccess file to remove that:

	RedirectMatch 301 ^/blog/(.*)$ /$1

This line will redirect `http://yourblog.com/blog/my-awesome-article` to `http://yourblog.com/my-awesome-article` and Kirby will take care of displaying the correct content for you. 

## How to update?

Download the **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master text: latest version)** and extract the ZIP. Remove the old kirby system folder from your site and replace it with the new one from the latest version. That's it!
