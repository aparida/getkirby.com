I was extremely happy to hear that Christian Reber – the CEO of 6Wunderkinder – has (link: http://christianreber.com/blog/from-tumblr-to-kirby text: switched his personal blog from Tumblr to Kirby) just recently. 

## Kirby Knowledge-Base App

Today I got mail that Christian and his teammates also built a (link: http://christianreber.com/blog/facebook-like-documentation-for-your-startup-made-with-kirby text: Kirby-powered knowledge-base application) for 6Wunderkinder, which is now available as (link: https://github.com/christianreber/kirbycms-knowledge-base text: open-source add-on for Kirby).

>For months I've been struggling to find the perfect solution for a simple centralized wiki (or similar) for 6Wunderkinder. My goal was to have a central place to document everything about our company: a simple onboarding-process for new employees, product documentation for both designers and developers, processes, development resources and a lot more. Even our internal API documentation should live there. We trialled various tools over the last few months, yet nothing remained simple enough for our needs.

Inspired by (link: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ text: Facebook's Developer Documentation), (twitter: christianreber text: Christian) and (twitter: rafifyalda text: Rafif) built a fantastic add-on for Kirby, which offers all the things you need to build a great knowledge-base for your company. No matter if you make it public or keep it behind your company's firewall, this is a really great tool to collect and write down all the things that are important for your team. 

### Dropbox-powered

6wunderkinder (link: blog/kirby-meets-dropbox text: connected their version with Dropbox) to get an even more flexible tool. This is not only great for updating content in the knowledge-base, but also to connect it to global, Dropbox-hosted files, which are relevant for the entire team (logos, fonts, all kinds of company docs, etc.)

### Self-hosted & fully adjustable

Since this is a self-hosted solution, you are entirely free to customize the add-on and fit it to your company's brand design. With Kirby's simple architecture there's hardly any limitation to extend the 6wunderkinder add-on with new features for your company. 

### Most affordable 

The low price of a (link: buy text: Kirby license) together with the open-source license for the knowledge-base add-on makes this solution a steal. 

I'm super excited about those news and I hope you like the 6Wunderkinder knowledge-base as much as I do. If you like it, consider to (link: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4342426 text: vote for it on Hacker News).
