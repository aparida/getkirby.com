Yesterday my mind was officially blown, when (link: http://sashtown.de/ text: Sascha Lack) released his latest project – (link: http://sashtown.de/smart-projects-kirby-theme text: **The Smart Projects Kirby Theme**).

The name is totally misleading, because it's so much more than just a theme for Kirby. In fact – even though it's the first version – this is a **fully usable project management tool for web designers and developers** build with Kirby. 

The design Sascha came up with is very clean and you can (link: http://smartprojects.sashtown.de/docs text: get started following his docs) in a matter of minutes to organize your own projects. 

The tool is a prefect example of scratching your own itch. Probably all web designers and developers know the problem of handling project-specific data sent by the client. Keeping track of FTP-Accounts, all kinds of passwords, URLs, Database connection details, etc, can get super chaotic and Sascha's theme is just awesome to stay organized. 

Since all you have to do for a new client is to add a new folder with a new text file, adding and updating data is very fast. You can stick to your favorite text editor and a very clean file structure:

## Install locally

It is highly recommended to only use this tool locally with MAMP or XAMPP. It's just too risky to keep your critical client details on a server somewhere unless you have a very secure setup you completely trust in.


## Print previews

Sascha really thought of everything and so you get nice minimalistic print previews of your client overviews, just in case you want to hand them a sheet with their own data some day.

## It's yours 

I might be biased (I'm definitely biased :)) but what I love the most about having such a project management tool is the fact that it is truly yours. 

You are in control of extending it and adjusting it to your workflow. I see Sascha's work as a fantastic starting point, but it's up to you to create your own fields for your client projects, it's up to you to build your own templates, adjust the design, add additional features – It's all just basic HTML, CSS, PHP, text files and folders. 

## Abuse Kirby

I think this is also a perfect example how to abuse Kirby. It can be so much more than just a simple CMS. If you are interested in more abstract Kirby projects, you should also take a look at the (link: blog/tax-admin text: Tax system concept) or the (link: http://styles.getkirby.com text: Kirby Styleguide theme). 

I hope you like Sascha's work as much as I do and I'm sure he's happy about any kind of feedback – either here or (twitter: sashtown text: on Twitter).
