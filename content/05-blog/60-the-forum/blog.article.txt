It has been on my todo list for a long time and I'm very happy to announce that today I'm officially launching the brand new (link: forum text: **Kirby Forum**). 

The forum will be there for you to get connected with each other, to get and offer support and to simply talk about all kinds of Kirby-related topics. I hope it will become a great place, where we all can discuss and exchange ideas, where you can hunt me down for bugs and which will hopefully become some kind of Kirby-community-brain. 

## Forum Threads

**(link: forum/general text: General)** 
Pretty much anything that won't fit into the other threads. 

**(link: forum/issue-tracker text: Issue Tracker)**
Found a bug? Submit it here!

**(link: forum/extensions text: Extensions)**
Got an idea for a plugin, or you've created a new snippet? Tell us about it!

**(link: forum/panel text: The Panel)**
Especially while the Panel is still in beta, this is the place to submit your feature requests, issues or anything else, which is related to the (link: panel text: Kirby Panel). 

**(link: forum/job-board text: Job Board)**
You are looking for someone to help you with a Kirby project? 
You are a developer, who's looking for work? Get connected here. 

### Anything missing?

Do you feel like a thread is missing? Anything else you want to discuss in the forum? Please let me know: <bastian@getkirby.com>
  
## How can I join? 

Anybody, who's got a **Twitter account** can login to the (link: forum text: Kirby Forum) The good thing: you don't need another account and I don't have to store your passwords on the Kirby server. 

## Built with Kirby

The Forum is entirely built on Kirby â€“ no forum software involved.

It's a simple plugin, which will be available for all Kirby users soon. It uses regular Kirby content folders for threads, the same plugin, templates and snippets system and a MySQL database for topics, users and posts. You can add it to any existing Kirby page or build a dedicated forum site with it. Stay tuned for updates!

## Get started

As you will see, the (link: forum text: forum) is still pretty empty. So please don't be shy and start your first topics. 

It's also still a very early version of the forum extension, so please let me know if you run into any bugs.

Can't wait to hear what you think about it and to read your first posts.

Cheers, Bastian
