I'm very happy that the problem already seems to be solved. Anthony just sent me an email and confirmed in a (link: http://twitter.com/#!/kolber/status/144740487125925888 text:Tweet) that it is not his code and I promised to put a link to Stacey in the Kirby docs so everyone can decide which cms fits best to their needs. 

I'm also very thankful for all the nice replies on Twitter. I will go on with Kirby and I think it's now up to you, if it will be worth it or not :)

Cheers, Bastian
