*– Mr. Made Up Client*

Ever had that kind of client briefing? 
If you hear something like this, you definitely know it's (link: http://fancybox.net/ text: Fancybox) time. 

Though lightbox and fancybox scripts are around for quite a long time, they are still a good way to build image galleries or to provied bigger previews of small thumbnails on a site. 

In this tutorial I'm going to show you, how to implement the famous jQuery fancybox plugin together with images from your content folders. Demo? Of course **(link: blog/fancybox/demo text: there's a demo!)**


## Getting started

1. (link: http://fancybox.net/ text: Download the Fancybox script). 
I'm still using the 1.3.4 for this tutorial but it will work with the new 2.x versions as well. 

2. Add the `fancybox` folder with all scripts and files to your site. 
I'm adding mine to the `assets` folder (assets/fancybox)

3. Add the latest version of jQuery and the Fancybox script file 
(`jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.js`) to the `<head>` of your template.

4. Add the Fancybox stylesheet (`jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.css`)
to the `<head>` of your template.

The `<head>` section should now looks something like this: 

```

<head>

  …
	
  <?php echo css('assets/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.css') ?>

  <?php echo js('http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js') ?>
  <?php echo js('assets/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.js') ?>

  …

</head>

```

## The thumb plugin

The Fancybox works best for small thumbnails of images, which link to the original big version of the image. To avoid generating thumbnails manually, you can download and install the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/thumb text: Thumb Plugin). Please also read the tutorial (link: blog/thumb-plugin text: how to install and use it). 

**I will use the Thumb plugin in this tutorial without further explanation.**

## A single Gallery

If you want to display a single gallery on a page, the best way is to put all images for the gallery into the content folder of that page. You can add additional text files to add captions and info for each image. (link: blog/masonry text: See also the Masonry tutorial for more instructions). 

In the template for that page you can build a list of images for the gallery like this…

```
<?php if($page->hasImages()): ?>
<ul class="gallery">
  <?php foreach($page->images() as $image): ?>
  <li>
    <a rel="gallery" href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>"><?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 200, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true)) ?></a>
  </li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
<?php endif ?>

```

You can see that I'm using the Thumb plugin to automatically get a cropped small version of each image from the content folder. I'm also linking each image to the original big image file. The cool thing about the Fancybox plugin is that even if it breaks the links will still work and your visitors will still be able to see the big image when they click on a thumbnail. 

### The rel attribute

You can also see that I'm using `rel="gallery"` in this example. Fancybox uses that rel attribute to group images. Because we are building a list of a bunch of images here it would be nice if the Fancybox would have those "next" / "previous" arrows, so users can jump to the next or previous image. Grouping images with the same rel attribute will exactly enable that. 

### Adding a caption

If you want Fancybox to display a description below each image you can add an additional title tag to the link:

```
…
<a title="My Caption" rel="gallery" href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>"><?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 200, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true)) ?></a>
…
```

### Initializing the Fancybox script

We've already added the Fancybox plugin to the header of our site, but we still need to activate it. Add the following lines to a new javascript file and add it to the `<head>` section.

```

$(function() {
  
  $('.gallery a').fancybox();

});

```

This will look for all `a` tags inside the `.gallery` list and apply the Fancybox magic to it. All gallery links should now open in a fancy Fancybox overlay instead of a plain new page. 

### Customizing Fancybox

The plugin has dozens of options you can use to customize the result. Please read the (link: http://fancybox.net/api text: Fancybox docs) for more information


## Multiple Galleries

If you want to show more than just one gallery per page, the easiest way is to have a content subfolder for each gallery. The structure would be something like this:

(image: 01.png)

Create a new `galleries.php` template (site/templates/galleries.php)

For that template we are going to use two nested foreach loops:

```

<?php foreach($page->children() as $gallery): ?>

<div class="gallery">

  <h2><?php echo $gallery->title() ?></h2>
  
  <ul>
    <?php foreach($gallery->images() as $image): ?>
    <li>
      <a rel="<?php echo $gallery->uid() ?>" href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>"><?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 200, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true)) ?></a>
    </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
  </ul>

</div>

<?php endforeach ?>

```

So with the first foreach loop we are going to create a div, the title (h2) and a unordered list for each subpage (gallery) and within that first loop we are using another nested foreach loop to create a list element + image tag for each image inside that subfolder (gallery). 

### The rel attribute

In this case it is important to define a unique rel attribute for each gallery, so the Fancybox plugin can group the images correctly. I'm using `$gallery->uid()` here, which will echo the name of the gallery folder. This will be unique and that's exactly what we need here. 

To activate the plugin we could use the same code snippet as in the single gallery example, but it's better to make the selector a bit more specific, so you could have an additional link outside the image list for each gallery. 

```
$(function() {
  
  $('.gallery li a').fancybox();

});
```

## The CSS

I'm not going to give you a full-featured gallery theme. I think you will have your own ideas how to style it :)

Here's just the one I used in the demo, but it's very rough:

```

.gallery {
  width: 860px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 50px 0;
}
.gallery ul {
  width: 1000px;
}
.gallery li {
  float: left;
  list-style: none;
  width: 200px;
  margin-right: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 40px;
  line-height: 0;
}
.gallery li a {
  border: 0;
}

```
