## The conference

I've attended (link: http://2012.beyondtellerrand.com text: beyond tellerrand) twice already and both events have been amazing. (twitter: marcthiele text: Marc) is one of the most passionate guys I know, and the effort he puts into his conferences and to create the best line-up is outstanding. 

beyond tellerrand is a mix between the English word *beyond* and the German word *tellerrand*, which means the egde of a plate. There's the German saying *"Über den Tellerrand schauen"* which means literally *to see beyond the edge of the plate* or to think outside the box. With this great motto, Marc has converted the former Flash conference into an inspiring 2-days event with high-quality talks all about the future of the web, mobile and design. 

Not all speakers are confirmed yet, but the ones who are already on the list are reason enough to not miss this:
