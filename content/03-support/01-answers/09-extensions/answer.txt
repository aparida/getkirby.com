You can find a bunch of plugins and snippets in the (link: downloads text: Downloads) section. All of them are free and open-source. Additionally you can find the source code for all of them on (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions text: Github)

More will be added over time and you are welcome to submit your own plugins or snippets.
