Title: Do you recommend any text editors?
----
Text:

In general every text editor with utf-8 support does the job. Even TextEdit on the Mac or the default Windows text editor is just fine. 

If you need better support for Markdown syntax, there are some great Markdown editors available: 

- iA Writer (<http://iawriter.com>)
- Mou (<http://mouapp.com/>)
- Byword (<http://bywordapp.com/>)
- Marked (<http://markedapp.com/>)
